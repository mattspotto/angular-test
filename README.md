# Angular Test

This project demonstrates a simple food/drinks menu using Bootstrap and Angular as well as a simple booking form with validation.

I have used the AngularJS official [seed project](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) to start me off and also used a number of directives from [angular-bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/).
